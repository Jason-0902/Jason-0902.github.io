# Relational Algebra CLI Simulator

This project is a simple command-line simulator for relational algebra queries, written in Python and structured like a minimal database engine.

It supports commands like `CREATE TABLE`, `SELECT`, `PROJECT`, `RENAME`, `JOIN`, and more, mimicking the behavior of SQL/SQLite.

## Usage

Run `main.py` in a Python environment to start the CLI.
